# YouNote - Notetaking Companion
YouNote is a notetaking productivity app used to integrate a text editor and video player. YouNote creates a separate page for each video and allows a seamless integration of a traditional editor and stickynotes so that users can take notes while watching educational and/or self-help videos.
